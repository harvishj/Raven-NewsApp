# NewsApp Description

We aim to build a news website namely ‘Raven’. We see a lot of news sources
such as tv channels, websites, and apps around but all of them have certain
drawbacks that users might not like. We wish to build a website inclusive of the
Universal principles of HCI, Design principles, and some aspects where current
websites lag to provide an easy user interface.
We can observe from other websites that in today’s age the news and incidents
around us are not child friendly. But this does not imply that we should shut off
kids from the global news. They must be provided with some environment where
news reading becomes fun and frolic activity also keeps them updated. Older
adults also encounter problems due to smaller fonts in the newspaper. To solve
this issue the app can provide bigger fonts according to their needs.

Our App Includes:
+ Kid's section
+ News based on location
+ Can change the language of the app
+ Can change the font size of the app
+ Tabs to select choice of news category and filter news accordingly
+ Share news
+ Search news
+ Dark and light themes
+ Bookmark news
+ A listener mode for people who wish to listen to the headlines rather than reading them
+ Meaning of the complex words for kids
+ Blog's Section
+ Download E-newspaper
